# Unreal_Demonstration
Demonstration of Unreal capabilities by the creation of different terrains and having the character explore. The different terrains include, an island, an abandoned factory with a possible dark history, and a murder mystery inspired exhibit of 4 different views which the user can explore and try to guess what really happened.
